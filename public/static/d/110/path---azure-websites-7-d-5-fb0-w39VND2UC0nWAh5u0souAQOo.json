Some of the big improvements are a new shared tier hosting, A-Record support and Fast-CGI support.</p>\n<p>One of the features I like is GitHub and CodePlex continuous integration support. He has some demonstrations on how you can push changes into your repository and they automatically get loaded onto the website.</p>\n<p>I have avoided using Azure in the past because of price and a-record support, but now with the new pricing structure I will probably use Azure going forward for small sites.</p>\n<p>Azure also supports PHP and Node.js applications. They even host Linux VMs if you need a Linux VM.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Azure Websites","date":"20.09.2012","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/azure-websites","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/slides-from-this-years-jax-code-camp"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Slides from this years JaxCodeCamp","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/5-days-until-jacksonville-code-camp-2012"},"frontmatter":{"title":"5 Days until Jacksonville Code Camp 2012","category":"Blog"}}}}
