{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>2007 has been an exiting year for me because of many changes in my life. The ColdFusion 8 launch was very exiting and has been successful for Adobe. I wish I had more time to devote to the JaxFusion user group this year to cover all of the new features.</p>\n<p>I also started a new job working as a technical consultant. I did that to get more hands on experience using the BI features in SQL Server 2005. I also have had the opportunity to work with Microsoft Sharepoint and .NET this year. It has been great to learn new things related to these other products. </p>\n<p>I just wanted to wish everyone a happy and safe new year.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Happy New Year","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/happy-new-year","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/heat-maps-in-sql-reporting-services-2005"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Heat Maps in SQL Reporting Services 2005","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/happy-holidays-from-jacksonville"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Happy Holidays from Jacksonville","category":"Blog"}}}}
