I have been beta testing the framework for a new application I have been working on for last couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>This is the first release of the Fusebox framework that has not required a rewrite of your application to upgrade the framework. All fusebox.xml and circuit.xml files will run as they did in version 4.0 and 4.1.</p>\n<p>The core files are now CFCs for the most part. There is also a new fusebox.loadclean keyword that can be used to recompile the app from the xml files.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fusebox 5 released!","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/fusebox-5-released","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/fusebox-and-frameworks-conference"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fusebox and Frameworks conference","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/fusebox-unity"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fusebox Unity?","category":"Blog"}}}}
