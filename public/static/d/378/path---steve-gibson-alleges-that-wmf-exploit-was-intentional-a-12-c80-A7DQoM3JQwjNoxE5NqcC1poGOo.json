If Steve's claim is true, it is really damning. If Microsoft is serious about Security, why would they put a hole into the OS. This was either a rouge microsoft programmer or something more sinister.</p>\n<p>I currently use Windows and a Mac. My home computer is a Mac, and my work computer is a Windows laptop that my company gave me to use. Outside of work, I no longer use Windows. It is bad enough with all the spyware and malware written for Windows, but nobody needs Microsoft leaving intentional holes into their OS.</p>\n<p>I really hope the Justice Department takes a look at this right away. Microsoft needs to open their source to developers outside of Microsoft to make sure that there are not any more holes like this in the OS.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Steve Gibson alleges that WMF exploit was Intentional","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/steve-gibson-alleges-that-wmf-exploit-was-intentional","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/macromedia-ships-studio-8"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Macromedia ships Studio 8","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/steve-robinson-and-brian-merrill-now-on-the-sunshine-drenchy-podcast"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Steve Robinson and Brian Merrill now on the Sunshine Drenchy Podcast","category":"Blog"}}}}
