{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I was reading some of the ColdFusion blogs, and I saw that <a href=\"http://www.bryantwebconsulting.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/7/20/August-1-2011-is-How-I-Started-ColdFusion-Day\" title=\"Steve Bryant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Steve Bryant</a> had suggested about writing a post on how developers got started in ColdFusion development. I decided to write a blog post on how I got started doing ColdFusion development, and how it changed my life for the better.</p>\n<p>I after I finished college in 1992, I got a job working for a company called Impact Publishing. I was hired initially to typeset black copy in a program called Aldus Pagemaker. That job eventually led to me to running a pre-press department for that company. Part of that job was making sure all of the Apple Macintosh computers ran properly on the network, and writing AppleScripts for automation. I also was starting to do web design using HTML.</p>\n<p>By the end of the 90's I had moved into the IT department. While working for the technology group I heard that the company was sending group of our web developers to a three day training class on how to use ColdFusion 4.5. I convinced my boss to let me tag along with the developers since it would only cost an extra $200.00. During the class I fell in love with the language because it was built with the web in mind. I did not realize at the time, but ColdFusion is a DSL (domain specific language). Since it was based on <CFTags>, similiar to HTML tags, the code mixed with the other tags in a very natural way.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: coldfusion\"><cfquery name=\"myQuery\" datasource=\"database\">SELECT username FROM tblusers WHERE clue &gt; 0</cfquery>\n<cfoutput query=\"myQuery\">#username#  \n</cfoutput>\n</pre>\n<p>I did ColdFusion development for nearly six years exclusively. As ColdFusion grew and improved with new versions, I grew and improved with the language. When ColdFusion MX/6 came out, I started using ColdFusion Components to do object oriented programming. Then when ColdFusion 7 was released, I started using the new gateway features for integration. ColdFusion led me into SQL Server development, which led me into .NET development, which led me into iOS development.</p>\n<p>One of the nice things about the ColdFusion community is that they are pretty progressive about adopting good practices and new technologies. In a lot of ways they are more advanced than the ASP.NET community. A lot of the good practices and frameworks have been adopted in the ASP.NET community, such as the JQuery library and the ASP.NET MVC framework.</p>\n<p>I really enjoy doing ASP.NET MVC development. It is about the closest experience I have had to doing ColdFusion development</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How I Got Started in ColdFusion","date":"09.11.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":2}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-i-got-started-in-cold-fusion","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/asp-net-mvc-3-power-point-presentation-and-notes-from-jax-code-camp"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ASP.NET MVC 3 PowerPoint Presentation and Notes from Jax Code Camp","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/jax-code-camp-sessions-times-have-been-posted"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Jax Code Camp Sessions Times have been Posted","category":"Blog"}}}}
