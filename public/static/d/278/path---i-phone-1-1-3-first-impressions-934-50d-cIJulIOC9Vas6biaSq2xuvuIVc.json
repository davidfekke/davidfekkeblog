{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I got home last night and installed the latest iPhone update, version 1.1.3. This update includes a new version of the Google Maps with a location aware feature. This uses triangulation from Cell towers to find your position on the map. This works well enough that I am planning using this instead of getting hand held GPS.</p>\n<p>One of the other cool features is the ability to reorganize icons on the home screen and even create additional screens.</p>\n<p>On the downside, the Uconnect feature still does not work with the bluetooth in the iPhone. I was hoping Apple would fix this, but it still fails to complete the calls.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"iPhone 1.1.3 First Impressions","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-phone-1-1-3-first-impressions","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-phone-development-first-observations"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iPhone Development First Observations","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-phone-2-2-update-breaks-my-gig-bluetooth-connection"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iPhone 2.2 update breaks MyGig Bluetooth Connection","category":"Blog"}}}}
