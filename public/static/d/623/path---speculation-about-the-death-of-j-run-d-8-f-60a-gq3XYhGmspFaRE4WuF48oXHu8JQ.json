Let me speculate about what Adobe might be doing about JRun. Currently the standalone version of ColdFusion runs on a JRun runtime.

JBOSS is an open source J2EE server. The company that develops and supports this server was recently purchased by Red Hat. </p>\n<p>It is extremely dificult right now to deploy ColdFusion for JBOSS, but it is possible. Adobe might be planning to use JBOSS for their future J2EE development, and just deploy ColdFusion on top of JBOSS for their Standalone version.</p>\n<p>I am curious to see what Adobe is up to none the less.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Speculation About The Death of JRun","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/speculation-about-the-death-of-j-run","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/spry-1-1-adds-data-set-explorer-tool"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spry 1.1 adds DataSet explorer tool","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/south-west-signal-needs-cold-fusion-developer"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SouthWest Signal Needs ColdFusion Developer","category":"Blog"}}}}
