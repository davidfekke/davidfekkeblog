{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A client of mine ran into an interesting problem trying to debug a Sharepoint 2007 workflow. Whenever they try to attach the debugger to the w3wp.exe process that is running the workflow, they get a dialog that says \"Access is Denied\".</p>\n<p>What is weird about this is they are logged in as administrator, and this is on the same box as the Sharepoint Server. The only thing that I see that is different is that the box has a x64 processor. I am curius if anyone else has run into this problem with Visual Studio 2005?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Visual Studio 2005 Attach to Debugger Access is Denied Error","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/visual-studio-2005-attach-to-debugger-access-is-denied-error","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/visual-studio-2008-service-pack-preparation-tool-does-not-work"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack Preparation Tool does not work","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/vista-ultimate-on-a-mac"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vista Ultimate on a Mac?","category":"Blog"}}}}
