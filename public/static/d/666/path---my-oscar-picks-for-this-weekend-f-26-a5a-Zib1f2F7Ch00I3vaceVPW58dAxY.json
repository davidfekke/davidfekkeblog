{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Oscars are this weekend, and I thought I would make my Oscar picks for this year and give my explanation as to why the academy will pick a nominee. Best Motion Picture of the Year:</p>\n<p>Brokeback Mountain will when best picture. The academy will not be able to resist giving an Oscar to a movie about gay cowboys. I have not seen this one yet, but I doubt I will since that South Park episode about the independant film festival. In that episode, all independant films were about gay cowboys.</p>\n<p>Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role:</p>\n<p>Philip Seymour Hoffman will win for Capote. Hoffman is an Oscar fav, but I hope it goes to Terrence Howard for Hustle in Flow. His performances in Crash and Hustle and Flow and Crash were incredible.</p>\n<p>Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role:</p>\n<p>Dame Judi Dench will win for Mrs. Henderson Presents. She is always an Oscar fav.</p>\n<p>Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role:</p>\n<p>Matt Dillon will win for Crash. The Academy always loves a bad cop. Plus it is Matt Dillon, and he has been around for long time.</p>\n<p>Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role:</p>\n<p>Frances McDormand will win for North Country. McDormand is always a Oscar fav, plus she is married toa Coen brother, and that does not hurt.</p>\n<p>Best Achievement in Directing:</p>\n<p>Ang Lee will win for Brokeback Mountain. And Lee will be redeimed for making The Incedible Hulk, even though I liked that movie.</p>\n<p>Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen:</p>\n<p>Crash by Paul Haggis will win this one. Crash has themes that the Academy and I for that matter love. Paul is a great writter and I hope he wins this one.</p>\n<p>Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published:</p>\n<p>Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana will win for Brokeback Mountain. Larry McMurtry has penned many of the great screenplay for the last 40 years. The Academy loves him. I am personally partial to Lonesome Dove and Hud.</p>\n<p>Best Achievement in Cinematography:</p>\n<p>Rodrigo Prieto will win for Brokeback Mountain. This movie was shot in Canada, and it is impossible to make Canada look bad on film.</p>\n<p>Best Achievement in Editing:</p>\n<p>Michael Kahn will win for Munich. Plus he is the only nominee that still edits movies by splicing film together on a moviola. All the rest use computers now.</p>\n<p>I will the the rest of my picks this afternoon.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Oscar picks for this weekend","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":2}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/my-oscar-picks-for-this-weekend","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-rest-of-my-oscar-picks"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The rest of my Oscar picks","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/orchard-cms-presentation-tomorrow-at-jaxdug"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Orchard CMS Presentation tomorrow at JAXDUG","category":"Blog"}}}}
