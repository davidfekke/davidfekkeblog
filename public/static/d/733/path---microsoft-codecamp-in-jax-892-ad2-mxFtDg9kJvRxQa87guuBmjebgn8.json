Microsoft has completely rewritten this tool as a Visual Studio tool called SSIS (SQL Server 2005 Integration</p>\n<p>Services). </p>\n<p>You can use conditional logic to handle failures and loop through transformations. This can all be done from a Drag and Drop GUI interface. It does support scripting with VB.NET.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Microsoft codecamp in Jax","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/microsoft-codecamp-in-jax","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/jax-fusion-roundtable-meeting-last-night"},"frontmatter":{"title":"JaxFusion Roundtable meeting last night","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/jax-sql-user-group-tomorrow-on-sql-server-2008-t-sql-enhancements"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Jax SQL User Group tomorrow on SQL Server 2008 T-SQL Enhancements","category":"Blog"}}}}
