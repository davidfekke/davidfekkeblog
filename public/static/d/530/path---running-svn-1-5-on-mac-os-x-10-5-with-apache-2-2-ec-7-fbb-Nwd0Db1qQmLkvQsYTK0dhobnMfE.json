{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I use subversion at work, but I have been wanting to run a subversion server at home. On Windows I use Visual SVN server, but at home I am running Mac OS X on all of my home computers. I use one of my Macs as a server.</p>\n<p>Here is the good news.

I did have to change the chmod to \"www\" instead of \"_www\". I was not able to get trac working.

I am really liking this web application for doing my bug tracking. It also integrates with subversion and will send SMS messages.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Running SVN 1.5 on Mac OS X 10.5 with Apache 2.2","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":2}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/running-svn-1-5-on-mac-os-x-10-5-with-apache-2-2","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/sap-abap-will-not-generate-proxy-to-cold-fusion-soap-web-service"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SAP ABAP will not generate Proxy to ColdFusion SOAP Web Service","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ryan-block-says-hd-dvd-is-on-a-death-watch"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ryan Block says HD DVD is on a Death Watch","category":"Blog"}}}}
