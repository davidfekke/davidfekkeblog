{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I live in Jacksonville, and AOL has a large Call Center down the street from my home. Well AOL lost 875,000 subscribers last quarter, so they are closing that call center. I was once an AOL user back in the day, but I got an actual internet ISP account in 1994. So I have not used AOL in 12 years. I remember when they were a Mac only service as well.</p>\n<p>I certainly feel bad for the employees who lost their jobs today, but I think the writting has been on the wall for AOL for a long time.</p>\n<p>They had an extremely nice facilty here in Jax. AOL is having Job fairs to try to place the 1200 workers who lost their jobs today.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"AOL Call Center Shutdowns in my neighborhood","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/aol-call-center-shutdowns-in-my-neighborhood","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/api-documentation-rtfm-please"},"frontmatter":{"title":"API documentation: RTFM please!","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-lot-of-content-available-for-xml-presentation"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A lot of content available for XML presentation","category":"Blog"}}}}
