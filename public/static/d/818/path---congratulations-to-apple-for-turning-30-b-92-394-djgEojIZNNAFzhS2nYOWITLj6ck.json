{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I was just thinking back to my earliest experiences with Apple computers. When I was child, my elementary school has a lab of Apple II's. I started programming with the Apple Basic that WOZ had added to the ROMs on the Apple II. From that point on I was hooked to personal computing. Since 1986 I have owned six different Apple computers, five of them were Macintosh's including the G5 I use as my home computer now.</p>\n<p>In the 90s when I was working in the print publishing industry, I really started to cut my teeth scripting with AppleScript.</p>\n<p>In the 30 year history of Apple Computer, I have watched the company go from a media loved company, to a media hated company, back to a media loved company.</p>\n<p>My attitude towards the company has not changed. I am a loyal customer, I love their products, yet they still piss me off from time to time. I look forward to seeing the products they produce over the next 30 years.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Apple for making it this far.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Congratulations to Apple for turning 30","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/congratulations-to-apple-for-turning-30","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/congratulations-to-the-phillies-and-to-the-rays"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Congratulations to the Phillies and to the Rays","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/cold-fusion-mx-7-now-has-mac-os-x-installer"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ColdFusion MX 7 now has Mac OS X installer","category":"Blog"}}}}
