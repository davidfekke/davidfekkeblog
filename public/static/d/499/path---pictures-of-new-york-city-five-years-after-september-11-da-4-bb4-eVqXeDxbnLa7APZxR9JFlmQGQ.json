{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I just got back from a trip to New Jersey to participate in the FISA World Rowing championships. While I was there I had a chance to go into New York City for the day on Friday the 8th.</p>\n<p>Here is a <a href=\"http://www.fekke.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewImageList&#x26;directory=2006_0907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">link</a> to the pictures I took while I was in Manhattan. I have been to Ground Zero before. I was there about a two and half years ago. From what I understand, it has not changed at all since the last time I was there, so I decided to go to other places in the city this time.</p>\n<p>One of the feelings I got walking around the city was a strong sense of freedom and optimism. You almost would not know that there was an attack there five years ago. It was warm day with lots of sunshine. It felt a little more like Florida then the North East.</p>\n<p>If you have not had a chance to visit New York, I would highly recommend visiting. I plan on going back soon.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pictures of New York City five years after September 11","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pictures-of-new-york-city-five-years-after-september-11","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/plugged-on-the-cold-fusion-podcast"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Plugged on the ColdFusion Podcast","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/photoshop-is-too-expensive"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Photoshop is too expensive!!!","category":"Blog"}}}}
