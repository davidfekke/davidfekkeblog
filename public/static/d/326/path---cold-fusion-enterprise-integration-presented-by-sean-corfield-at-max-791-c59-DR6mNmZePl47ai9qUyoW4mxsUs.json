{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Sean Corfield had a terrific presentation today on Enterprise integration using ColdFusion. I found this very interesting</p>\n<p>because this is the kind of development I do everyday. He talked a lot about about messaging based systems for integrating enterprise data. The Two big ones are JMS and SOAP. </p>\n<p>Other were also mentioned like of the microsoft variety. The importance of making sure your integration code is \"loosely coupled\" was also brought up in the presentation.</p>\n<p>He also mentioned how security is becoming a bigger factor, like adding the ability to use SOAP headers in the request and responce to a Web Service.</p>\n<p>Some of the other ways organizations exange data is by ftping or httping flat files and xml files. Occasionally some use a shared database, but this is uncommon because of differences of database schemas.</p>\n<p>There is a function on cflib called listFix() for fixing inproperly formated csv files. </p>\n<p>After watching this presentation, I definately want to start looking at using JMS more for integration. Sean also mentioned that there are many different providers for this type of software including open source.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ColdFusion Enterprise Integration presented by Sean Corfield at MAX","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/cold-fusion-enterprise-integration-presented-by-sean-corfield-at-max","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/cold-fusion-ide-survey"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ColdFusion IDE survey","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/animation-and-user-interfaces"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Animation and User Interfaces","category":"Blog"}}}}
