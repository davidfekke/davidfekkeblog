{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have never seen Joe Rinehart speak before, so I was curious to see his MVC presentation.</p>\n<p>Some of his points from his presentation were that MVC is actually multiple design patterns, not just one. It combines three patterns, the Observer, Strategy and Compsite patterns.</p>\n<p>The Strategy pattern allows developers to loosely couple their applications. The Observer pattern acts like a listener. The Composition pattern refers to a has-a pattern where an object can be built with smaller objects. The controller works as the observer pattern.</p>\n<p>He then went into his Unity presentation. He did a demonstration with Reactor. Reactor uses the scaffold tag.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"MVC for you and me presentation by Joe Rinehart","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mvc-for-you-and-me-presentation-by-joe-rinehart","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/fekke-com-now-on-mxna"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fekke.com now on MXNA","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/max-2005-begins-in-less-than-an-hour"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MAX 2005 begins in less than an hour","category":"Blog"}}}}
