{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Apple Insider has a nice <a href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/19/inside_apples_new_xcode_4_development_tool.html\" title=\"Xcode 4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">preview</a> of the next version of Apple's Xcode IDE. Xcode 4 was previewed at WWDC, Apple's developer conference earlier this month. I have been developing applications in Xcode for a little over year, and it looks like it fixes a lot of the complaints that I and other developers have had about xcode 3 who have used Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest changes is that Interface Builder is no longer a separate application, it is built into Xcode. Another one of that changes is that there is a single window for the whole IDE. You can open up your header file and implementation file at the same time.</p>\n<p>I know this will make the Ruby developers happy, Xcode 4 supports git. Apple is also adding a timeline viewer so you can use a time machine like slider to look at you code changes as well as side by side comparisons of the different versions of the file.</p>\n<p>I am very excited about this release of Xcode.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Xcode 4 Preview at Appleinsider.com","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/xcode-4-preview-at-appleinsider-com","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/cfcomponent-style-attribute"},"frontmatter":{"title":"cfcomponent style attribute","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-am-using-php-bloging-software-for-jaxrow-org"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I am using php bloging software for jaxrow.org","category":"Blog"}}}}
