{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Last week Vince Bonfanti and Josh Adams came out to the <a href=\"http://www.jaxfusion.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">JaxFusion</a> user group to present on the next version of BlueDragon. The presentation was excellent, and I hope we can have back again. As good as the presentation was, we had a much lower turnout than I would have liked. Because of the turnout, I sent out a list of questions to the members of the user group who work internally at Vurv to get feedback. Not every member of the <a href=\"http://www.jaxfusion.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">JaxFusion</a> user group works at Vurv, so I decided to post these questions to my blog.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to leave comments on this blog post with answers to these questions;</p>\n<p>What do you want to see at future meetings? </p>\n<p>Is there a better meeting time that would be more convenient for most members? </p>\n<p>Would you prefer a different day of the week for the meetings?</p>\n<p>Would you like to have lunchtime meetings?</p>\n<p>Are there subjects you would like to see covered which are not being covered by the group?</p>\n<p>One idea has been to do Study Groups. Would anybody be interested in Study Groups for Flash, Flex, Apollo or ColdFusion 8?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Changes to JaxFusion","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/changes-to-jax-fusion","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/civilization-4-error"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Civilization 4 Error","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/cffile-file-error-shows-wrong-attribute-as-cause"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cffile file error shows wrong attribute as cause","category":"Blog"}}}}
