I am still getting used to the idea of giving my car software updates.</p>\n<p>This was for version 3.0 of the MyGig system software. The update took about 10 minutes to install. Harmon Becker cleaned up the interface with prettier icons. There is an icon on the bottom right hand corner of the map for tracking your path.</p>\n<p>My MyGig system has a 20 gigabyte hard drive. After the update it reset all of my phone numbers, and my paired phones. Chrysler does warn that stored numbers will be lost. I re-paired my iPhone 3G with the MyGig's bluetooth. Other than the issues with the phone, the upgrade was flawless.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"MyGig software update 3.0","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/my-gig-software-update-3-0","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-flex-new-years-resolution"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Flex New Year's Resolution","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-blog-has-been-upgraded-to-blog-cfc-5-6"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Blog has been Upgraded to BlogCFC 5.6","category":"Blog"}}}}
