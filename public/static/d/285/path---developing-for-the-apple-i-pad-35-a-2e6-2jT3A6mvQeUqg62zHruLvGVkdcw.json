According to Apple, iPhone applications will run unmodified on the iPad. Apple released a new SDK for the iPhone and iPad today.</p>\n<p>The new iPhone/iPad SDK is version 3.2. Many speculated it would be version 4.0, but they may be saving those features for this Summer. The iPad will cost $499, $599 and $799 for the WiFi only versions, and $629, $729 and $829 for the WiFi/3G versions. Flash memory sizes will range from 16 GB to 64 GB.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Developing for the Apple iPad","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/developing-for-the-apple-i-pad","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/dog-years-to-human-years-function-found-in-our-code"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DogYearsToHumanYears function found in our code","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/dell-selling-amd-processors"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dell selling AMD processors?","category":"Blog"}}}}
