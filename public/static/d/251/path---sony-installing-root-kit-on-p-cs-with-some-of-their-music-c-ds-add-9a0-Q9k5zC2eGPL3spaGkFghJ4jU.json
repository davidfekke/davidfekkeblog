{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I heard this weekend that Sony hired a company to develop a rootKit to be installed on the computer of the person listening to its CDs. If you are not familiar with rootKits, they alter the default functionality of an users operating system. This is very common behavior in spyware and malware. Apparently, they have been selling these CDs from the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>This is not the type of behavior I would expect from a major corporation like Sony, more like from a black hat hacker. I own a lot of sony products, but I do think I will be buying any of their music CDs any time soon.</p>\n<p>The CDs should be labeled with some sort of label advertising that they have copy protection.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sony installing RootKit on PCs with some of their music CDs","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/sony-installing-root-kit-on-p-cs-with-some-of-their-music-c-ds","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/blue-ray-vs-hddvd-why-sony-will-lose"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blue Ray vs. HDDVD: Why Sony will lose","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/small-datetime-gothca-in-sql-server-2000"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Small Datetime gothca in SQL Server 2000","category":"Blog"}}}}
