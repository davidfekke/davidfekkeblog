{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>It was ten years ago when Michael Dell answered a question about what Apple should do at an expo in Orlando with this comment;</p>\n<p>[code:c#]</p>\n<p>\"What would I do?

Apple is now worth more than twice then what Dell is worth as a company. To be fair, I think Michael regreted making that comment, but in the end it doesn not matter. Apple was able to inovate their way out of a crisis with good solid design.</p>\n<p>Dell on the other hand does not inovate, they rely on Microsoft and Linux to do the inovating. Dell is not a technology company, they are a logitics company. Apple has applied a lot of those principles to their business, but they did not forget about design in the process.</p>\n<p>I recently purchased a new laptop. I bought a MacBook Pro. I use it to run Vista and Mac OS X. I doubt I will ever buy a Dell.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Michael Dell should shut down Dell, and give the money back to the Shareholders","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/michael-dell-should-shut-down-dell-and-give-the-money-back-to-the-shareholders","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/microsoft-makes-a-bad-business-deal"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Microsoft makes a bad business deal?","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/mercury-new-media-is-hiring-two-cold-fusion-developers-in-tampa"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mercury New Media is hiring two ColdFusion Developers in Tampa","category":"Blog"}}}}
