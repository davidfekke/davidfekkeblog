{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I use a RSS news reader to subscribe to several tech sources. One of those sources is Wired.</p>\n<p>I used to be huge fan of Wired when the magazine first came out. They were incredibly inovative with there design and their editorial content. Granted a lot of it was unreadable because of the pink type on top of gold foil background from the latest eight color press. Even with the radical design, the editorial content was great. Here are the headlines that came into my reader today. </p>\n<div class=\"code\">Sony in Bad Need of Recharging  \n<p>Christians Should Have Great Sex  </p>\n<p>Record Pot Busts in 2005  </p>\n<p>Plug-In Hybrid to Power Grid  </p>\n<p>Playlisting Web 2.0</p>\n</div>\nI use to work as a journalist, and I realize that the same people who write headlines do not necessary write the articles. Maybe two of those are actually tech related.","frontmatter":{"title":"What happened to Wired","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/what-happened-to-wired","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/who-misspelled-referrer"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Who misspelled Referrer","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-is-the-greatest-movie-ever-made"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is the greatest movie ever made?","category":"Blog"}}}}
