{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The biggest reason I will not be buying an Apple iPhone is they are not on sell yet, but that is not the only reason.</p>\n<p>Now that I have left the Steve Jobs <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">reality distortion field</a>, there are a lot of features that I do like about the iPhone. I think the interface for the iPhone is truly revolutionary. From the demo I saw at the MacWorld keynote, the touch screen makes since for the best user input device for a smart phone. I had a Blackberry last year as my primary phone, but I was never really liked it that much.</p>\n<p>The iPhone is also missing a number of things that I have in my current phone. My current phone is a Cingular 3G phone. The iPhone is only an EDGE phone. It looks like Apple is compensating for that with WiFi built into the phone.</p>\n<p>It also looks like you will have to be a Cingular customer to get the phone. I hope that you will still be able to buy the phone unlocked. I think it is good that it is a GSM phone. In the US, there are only two GSM providers I know about, but this is the standard used outside the United States by most providers.</p>\n<p>Right now my next Apple purchase will most likely be a Mac Book Pro.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I will probably not be buying an iPhone","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/why-i-will-probably-not-be-buying-an-i-phone","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/why-internet-explorer-6-will-not-die"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Internet Explorer 6 will not Die","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/whose-fault-are-the-i-phone-4-reception-issues-answer-the-government"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Whose Fault are the iPhone 4 Reception issues;  Answer: The Government","category":"Blog"}}}}
