{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I am a big fan of open standards. One of the things that has prevented me from upgrading to a HDTV and a new high def player is that lack of a high def format standard.</p>\n<p>There have been two camps for the last couple of years for high def video players, Toshiba's HD-DVD and Sony's Blu-Ray. This past weekend Warner Brothers anounced that they were going drop support for HD-DVD and go with Blu-Ray exclusively. I read today on <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/07/paramount-following-warner-out-the-hd-dvd-door/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">engadget</a> that Paramount was switching to Blu-Ray. That leaves only one major studio behind HD-DVD, that being Universal, and I am sure Universal will drop support as well.</p>\n<p>I have not purchased one of these players yet because I did not want to get <em>Betamaxed</em>. I will probably buy a Blu-Ray player now, I am even thinking about getting a Play Station 3.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"HD-DVD is Dead to Me","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hd-dvd-is-dead-to-me","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/happy-holidays-from-jacksonville"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Happy Holidays from Jacksonville","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/guy-kawasaki-on-the-art-of-firing"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Guy Kawasaki on the Art of Firing","category":"Blog"}}}}
