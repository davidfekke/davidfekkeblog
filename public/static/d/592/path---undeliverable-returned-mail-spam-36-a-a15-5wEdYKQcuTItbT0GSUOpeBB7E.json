{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I try to avoid getting political on this blog, but I started noticing something alarming a couple of weeks ago with my inbox. I am receiving a couple of extra hundred emails a day that are undeliverable emails being returned to my inbox because my email address is listed as the sender. I did a little research on the interweb, only to find this is nothing new. Spam is a reality for anyone who has had an email account for any length of time. I use filters and anti-spam software, but I still get more and more spam to the point now my personal email address is almost unusable.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of friends who are against the death penalty, and want to see it done away with for good. I am taking the opposing view as of today.</p>\n<p>Not only do I believe we should keep the death penalty, but it should be extended to cover spammers. I also believe the death penalty should be extended to people who complain about airport noise after they build a house next to an airport, but that is a whole other blog entry.</p>\n<p>CAN-SPAM was supposed to fix this, but the problem has only gotten worse since the law was passed. The only real solution is a technological one. The fear of incarceration, or even death will not stop spammers.</p>\n<p>This system would need to have some sort of authentication similar to the one used for SSL certificates. All client and server software will need to be upgraded to use this system, but this is the only was I see the spam problem being fixed.</p>\n<p>In the mean time we should start executing spammers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Undeliverable/Returned Mail Spam","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/undeliverable-returned-mail-spam","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/user-group-tv"},"frontmatter":{"title":"User Group TV","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/two-senior-cold-fusion-developers-available-at-the-end-of-the-month"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Two Senior ColdFusion Developers Available at the End of the Month","category":"Blog"}}}}
