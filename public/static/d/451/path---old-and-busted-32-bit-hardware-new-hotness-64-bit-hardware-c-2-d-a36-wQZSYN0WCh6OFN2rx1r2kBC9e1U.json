{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I am taking a class on Microsoft SharePoint architecture this week. I learned today in the class that the next version of SharePoint will be 64 bit only. If you are going to be buying new server hardware, get 64 bit hardware.</p>\n<p>Not only does SharePoint run better on 64 bit hardware, so does MS SQL Server and ColdFusion. You can also take advantage of much more RAM. I believe that 32 bit hardware is limited to a maximum of 2-4 GBs. 64 bit hardware can go up to 256 Terabytes in theory.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Old and Busted: 32 bit hardware; New Hotness 64 bit hardware","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/old-and-busted-32-bit-hardware-new-hotness-64-bit-hardware","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/on-the-road-to-cfunited"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On the road to CFUNITED","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ok-i-did-it"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ok, I did it","category":"Blog"}}}}
