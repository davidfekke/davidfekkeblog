My new role will be working with Business Intelligence technologies in SQL Server 2005. I will also be doing some .NET development as well. The work I have been doing for the last three years has been related to business to business integration. A lot of my experience has been using ColdFusion to build these integrations, but we have also used SQL Server DTS as well as SSIS to accomplish these tasks.</p>\n<p>I will be posting more details about my new job in the next couple of weeks. Part of my new job will be doing consulting. I look forward to continuing to support the ColdFusion community as well as the SQL Server/.NET community.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I am going to the Darkside . . .","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-am-going-to-the-darkside","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-am-on-the-local-news-and-it-was-not-perp-walk"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I am on the Local News, and it was not Perp Walk","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-invoke-the-image-watcher-cfc"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to invoke the ImageWatcher CFC","category":"Blog"}}}}
