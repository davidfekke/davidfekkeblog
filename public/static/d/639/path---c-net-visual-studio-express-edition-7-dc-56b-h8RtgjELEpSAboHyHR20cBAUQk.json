{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Microsoft released a free IDE to build .NET applications when they released .NET 2.0 a while back. I have been using it to rewrite some utilities at work. I have to say I am pretty impressed so far. The IDE does not offer all of the features that the full Visual Studio 2005 does, but it still has a lot of power.</p>\n<p>It will work with SQL Server express edition and it has a feature for connecting to web services. </p>\n<p>Apple already offers a free IDE, and there are several in the Java world. This is a first for Microsoft, and I think ther will be a lot of new .NET application written because they released this IDE. Kudos to Microsoft.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C#.NET Visual Studio Express edition","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/c-net-visual-studio-express-edition","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/cs-3-released-today"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CS3 released today","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/cnbc-reporting-on-apple-i-phone"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CNBC reporting on Apple iPhone","category":"Blog"}}}}
