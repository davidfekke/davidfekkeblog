{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have been reading a couple of articles about Mac OS X running on x86 processors as a vmware disk image. If you have been living hole in the ground for the last couple of months, you might have heard that Apple is switching to Intel processors.</p>\n<p>The development machines that shipped have the installer disk, and so people have managed to install Mac OS X without the machine level copy protection. My personal opinion about the move to Intel is that is about time. </p>\n<p>As far as Apple selling the Mac OS for any pc, I think that is a bad idea. Apple is a hardware company, and besides that it is a lot easier to develope an operating system if you also make the hardware, rather than trying to make the Mac OS compatible with every piece of hardware out there.</p>\n<p>I own a Mac, and do most of my development on the Mac. Mainly because I am fed up with viruses and spyware, but I have always owned a Mac since 1993.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mac OS X on x86","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mac-os-x-on-x-86","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/macromedia-labs-annouced-today-at-max"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Macromedia Labs annouced today at MAX","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/mxna-bot-has-subscribe-and-un-subscribe"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MXNA bot has Subscribe and UnSubscribe","category":"Blog"}}}}
