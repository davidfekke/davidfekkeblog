My company is currently in the process of upgrading to 64 bit servers, but only where it makes sense.</p>\n<p>SQL Server 2005 has a 32 bit and a 64 bit version. The 64 bit version takes advantage of the 64 bit chips, but it also costs a lot more. Factor in the cost of the 64 bit version of Windows 2003 Server OS, and it gets pricey.</p>\n<p>From my tests with SSIS on this new hardware, ETLs that used to take hours now take minutes to run. Granted a lot of the speed improvements have come from code optimizations in SQL Server, but there is still a huge improvement from using the 64 bit hardware.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to see 64 bit version of ColdFusion. I know it would require having a 64 bit OS and JVM, but it would be nice to see ColdFusion take advantage of this new hardware.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Does ColdFusion need 64 bit Support?
