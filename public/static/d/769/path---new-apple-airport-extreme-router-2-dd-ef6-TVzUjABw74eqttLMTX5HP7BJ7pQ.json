{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I purchased one of the new Apple Airport Extreme wireless routers this weekend. I have been using one of the older D-Link routers that is a 802.11G router. The D-Link has worked alright, but I would have problems with losing my connections. A couple of years ago I purchased an Apple Airport Express router as a backup when I traveled, and it worked better than my regular wireless router. This new extreme router has a USB port so I can connect external hard drives and printers. It also has three Ethernet ports for any computers that do not have wireless cards.</p>\n<p>It is also is based on the new 802.11N standard. I am planning on upgrading my home to 802.11N, so this is the first step.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Apple Airport Extreme Router","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/new-apple-airport-extreme-router","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-free-cold-fusion-hosting-service"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New FREE ColdFusion Hosting Service","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/neat-loader-from-ajaxload-info"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Neat loader from ajaxload.info","category":"Blog"}}}}
