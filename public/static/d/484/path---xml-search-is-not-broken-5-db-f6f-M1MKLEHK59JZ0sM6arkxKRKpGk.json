{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I was wrong. XMLSearch is not broken. Steven Erat at Talking Tree made a post about this issue on his <a href=\"http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">blog</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue has to do with setting a namespace without using a prefix qualifier. Here is an example from Steven's blog;</p>\n<div class=\"code\"><font color=\"NAVY\"><BackgroundReports xmlns=<font color=\"BLUE\">\"[http://ns.r-xml.org/2004-08-02](http://ns.r-xml.org/2004-08-02)\"</font> ....></font></div>\nSince the xml sets a namespace without the qualifier, no namespace gets set at all. Because of this, the xPath has to be explicit;\n<div class=\"code\">/:BackgroundReports/:ProviderReferenceId/:IdValue</div>\nBy placing the colons after the forward slashes, you are telling the search that the elements are in a no-name namespace. This should return the results you are looking for in your xml.\n<p>Thank you Steven Erat for pointing out what was actually happening.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"XMLSearch is not broken","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/xml-search-is-not-broken","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/xml-search-function-still-broken-in-cold-fusion-7-0-1"},"frontmatter":{"title":"XMLSearch() function still broken in ColdFusion 7.0.1","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/xml-search-bug-fixed-with-this-udf"},"frontmatter":{"title":"XMLSearch bug fixed with this UDF","category":"Blog"}}}}
