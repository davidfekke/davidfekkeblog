The schedule has not been posted yet on the web site, but I just got notification that my presentation was selected. </p>\n<p>This presentation will be similiar to one I did in 2009. Objective-C is the primary language used for developing apps on the iOS and the Mac. There have been a lot of changes to the iOS SDK since I did that last presentation in 2009.</p>\n<p>The point of the presentation will be to familiarize Objective-C to C# and Java developers. There are a lot of similarities between C# and Objective-C. I will explore these so that C# or Java developer can walk away with better understanding using their existing knowledge.</p>\n<p>I hope we get a good turn out for the JaxCodeCamp this year. Please tell your developer friends to come out a week from Saturday.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Objective-C for C# Developers at Jax Code Camp on October 6th","date":"26.09.2012","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/objective-c-for-c-developers-at-jax-code-camp-on-october-6th","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/5-days-until-jacksonville-code-camp-2012"},"frontmatter":{"title":"5 Days until Jacksonville Code Camp 2012","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/next-jax-mug-meeting-september-24th-on-the-unity-3-d-ide"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Next JaxMUG meeting September 24th on the Unity 3D IDE.","category":"Blog"}}}}
