{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I moved my site to ASP.NET MVC 2.0 last year. I was disappointed that there was not a blogging software that was not written for the MVC framework. When I started doing research on MVC based blogging engines, there were not any that used a relational database as the content repository for the blog. There was one that was a work of progress, and that was Oxite. Oxite went on to become the Orchard Project.</p>\n<p>Orchard is a content management system. It is based on ASP.NET MVC 3.0, and allows you to add your own modules as well. The requirements for my site were pretty simple. I needed to have individual pages such as ‘About’ and ‘Contact Us’, but I also needed to be able to bring over my blog.</p>\n<p>Here are my experiences with installing orchard cms with the Microsoft webmatrix tool. I decided to port my home site using the new orchard since it is based on ASP.NET MVC 3.0.</p>\n<p>Setting up the dev site</p>\n<p>I used WebMatrix to created new orchard site on my Windows 7 box. When you create a new Orchard site if prompts you for a site name, admin username and password, as well the choice of a SQL CE or SQL Server database.</p>\n<p>Porting my blog</p>\n<p>My previous blog was hosted using blogengine.net. That blogging software can export the contents of the blog in the BlogML XML format. So I exported my blog, and used Nick Mayne’s BlogML module to import my blogml XML file.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How did I decide on the Orchard CMS","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-did-i-decide-on-the-orchard-cms","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-phone-2-2-update-breaks-my-gig-bluetooth-connection"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iPhone 2.2 update breaks MyGig Bluetooth Connection","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/fuseboxframework-org-launched"},"frontmatter":{"title":"fuseboxframework.org launched","category":"Blog"}}}}
