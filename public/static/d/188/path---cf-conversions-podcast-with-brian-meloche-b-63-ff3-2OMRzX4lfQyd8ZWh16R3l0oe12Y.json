{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I was saddened when I heard that the CFWeekly podcast was being retired. I thought Matt and Pete did an excellent job with that podcast. One of my favorite podcasts was when they had a round table of different CF developers. One of those developers was Brian Meloche.</p>\n<p>Brian is now hosting a new podcast called <a href=\"http://www.cfconversations.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CF Conversations</a>. The first podcast has a round table with Rick Mason, Adam Haskell, Jeff Coughlin and Aaron West. I listened it this morning, and I really like the format. Keep up the good work Brian.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"CFConversions Podcast with Brian Meloche","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/cf-conversions-podcast-with-brian-meloche","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/c-ds-infected-with-the-sony-bmg-root-kit"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CDs infected with the Sony-BMG RootKit","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/cfc-function-calls-in-pound-signs"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CFC function calls in pound signs","category":"Blog"}}}}
