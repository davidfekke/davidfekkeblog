{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I was in San Jose last week for the managers summit. While I was out there I noticed that a lot of the developers use Macs.</p>\n<p>I have been a Mac user since 1990, and I have a G5 for my home machine. I am trying to convince my company that I should get a MacBook Pro to replace my Dell laptop. <a href=\"http://www.corfield.org/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sean Corfield</a> brought up some good points to me about how to convince your boss to get you a Mac for development.</p>\n<p>The new MacBook Pro is an Intel based machine. Because it uses an x86 based processor, you can run multiple operating systems on it now. If you use <a href=\"http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">parallels</a>, you can even run multiple OSes at the same time, and test your web apps in each browser.</p>\n<p>If you host your applications on Unix servers, you can run your apps on the same OS that the server is running since Mac OS X is Unix based.</p>\n<p>I do not know if I will be able to convince my boss to get me a Mac, but if he does not, I will probably get one to replace my home machine. I just bought my G5 about a year and a half ago, so it will probably be awhile before I replace that machine.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Convincing Your Boss to Get You a Mac for Development","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/convincing-your-boss-to-get-you-a-mac-for-development","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/cool-sql-server-maintenance-scripts"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cool SQL Server Maintenance scripts","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/consuming-cold-fusion-web-services-in-microsoft-info-path"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Consuming ColdFusion Web Services in Microsoft InfoPath","category":"Blog"}}}}
