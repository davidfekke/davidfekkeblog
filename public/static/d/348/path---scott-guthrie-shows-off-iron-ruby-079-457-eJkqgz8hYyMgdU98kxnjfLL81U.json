They are also adding Lambda expressions and dynamic features to C# and VB.NET. There is already an implementation of Ruby running on Java called jRuby. Sun has also been promoting a new scripting language called <a href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/started.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Scala</a>. </p>\n<p>It is nice to see these language features being embraced by Microsoft and Sun. Dynamic scripting languages like ColdFusion are becoming more and more popular. It will be interesting to see if New Atlanta will use this new technology in the next version of BlueDragon.NET.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Scott Guthrie shows off IronRuby","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/scott-guthrie-shows-off-iron-ruby","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/sean-corfield-comments-on-cold-fusion-as-an-oo-language"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sean Corfield comments on ColdFusion as an OO language","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/scorpio-demo-today-at-the-jax-fusion-user-group"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Scorpio Demo today at the JaxFusion User Group","category":"Blog"}}}}
