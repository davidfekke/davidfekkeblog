{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I just finished watching the second day keynote at MAX. There was a lot of focus on Flash video, Flash lite, the next generation of Flash as well as Breeze.</p>\n<p>Adobe and Macromedia shared a demo on how to export video from After Effects into Flash 8. They showed how you can share an alpha channel, and line up the video in Flash.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Allaire gave a presentation on his video distribution network, BrightCove. You can even distribute video onto an iPod Video. The application front end for BrightCove is built in Flex.</p>\n<p>I have been through a couple of presentations on Actionscript 3.0 and Flex. Flex 2.0 is supposed to include a CF Adapter for providing AMF like functionality without having to use Flash remoting.</p>\n<p>The language improvements and VM changes for Actionscript 3.0 look very nice. The language will be type safe, and you will be able to register ColdFusion components in Flex as value objects.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Flash, Flex and more Flash at MAX","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/flash-flex-and-more-flash-at-max","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-pronounce-fekke"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to pronounce Fekke?","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-not-to-protest-101"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How not to Protest 101","category":"Blog"}}}}
