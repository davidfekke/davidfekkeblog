{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I read on Ben Forta's blog that Tim Buntel is leaving Adobe. Ben says he is going to follow his true passion as an educator.</p>\n<p>I used to run a user group in Tampa, and Tim came out to give a presentation on ColdFusion MX when it was first released. It was one of our biggest meeting the group had ever had. I was grateful that he came out. My parents are both teachers and I used to work as a Flight Instructor back in the 90s. I would still be Flight Instructing if my students did not keep on trying to kill me, but that should be left for another blog post. Teaching can be extremely satisfying and frustrating as the same time. I wish Tim good luck in his new career.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Tim Buntel leaving Adobe","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tim-buntel-leaving-adobe","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/tim-buntel-is-back-at-adobe"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tim Buntel is back at Adobe","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-reports-of-my-demise-have-been-greatly-exaggerated"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated","category":"Blog"}}}}
