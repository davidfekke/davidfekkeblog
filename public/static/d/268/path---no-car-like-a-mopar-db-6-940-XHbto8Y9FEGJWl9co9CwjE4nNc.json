{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I purchased a new car this weekend. It is an 08' Dodge Charger.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.fekke.com/blog/images//thumbCharger%20011.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The thing that really blew me away about this car was that it has a lot more electronic wizardry than any car I have ever had before. It came with Bluetooth, a voice activated audio and nav system, 20 gigabyte hard drive for pictures and MP3s, GPS system with live traffic updates. It even has an USB port for transferring MP3s and pictures.</p>\n<p>It will probably take me couple months to figure out how to work all of this stuff. I am still trying to figure out how to connect my iPhone so I can use the hands free features in the car. Overall, I am very impressed.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"No Car Like a Mopar","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/no-car-like-a-mopar","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/no-i-phone-3-g-for-you"},"frontmatter":{"title":"No iPhone 3G for you","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/nice-piece-on-unf-game-and-mobile-development-program"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nice Piece on UNF Game and Mobile Development Program","category":"Blog"}}}}
