{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have posted on this before, but the iPhone is coming out tomorrow. I am still not getting an iPhone.</p>\n<p>The biggest criticism I have seen for the iPhone is that Edge network is slow. My current Cingular phone is a 3G phone, and I get pretty good reception here in Jacksonville. Here are the other reasons why I am not getting one; No Mobile Java, No mobile Flash and no GPS. That being said, it is also a closed platform. My current cell phone, which is not a Smart phone can still run third party applications.</p>\n<p>YouTube is re-encoding all their videos for H264. Apple could have just supported Flash FLV, and YouTube would not have to re-encode all of their video.</p>\n<p>I guess AT&#x26;T and Apple are afraid that Skype are going to kill off AT&#x26;T's long distance business.</p>\n<p>I also think that some of the arguments against the iPhone are bogus. The complaint I have heard is battery life. Most cell phones turn the screen off when they are not in use. I have also read a lot of complaints about the touch screen. I think the virtual keyboard make a lot more sense than the current qwerty keyboards that ship with some smart phones. The keyboard on my Blackberry really sucked.</p>\n<p>If Apple where to offer 3G and GPS, I would buy an iPhone. Hopefully Apple will fix this with the next rev of the iPhone.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"iPhone is Almost Here, and I am Still not Getting One","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-phone-is-almost-here-and-i-am-still-not-getting-one","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-pod-nano-day-one"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iPod Nano day One","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-phone-development-at-jax-code-camp-tomorrow"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iPhone development at Jax Code Camp tomorrow","category":"Blog"}}}}
