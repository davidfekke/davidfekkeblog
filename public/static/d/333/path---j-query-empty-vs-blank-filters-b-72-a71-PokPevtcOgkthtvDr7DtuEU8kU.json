{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I ran into an issue this morning using a JQuery selector filter. One of the things I like about JQuery is that they have some pretty cool filters that you can use to specify different parts of your DOM.</p>\n<p>[code:c#]</p>\n<p>jQuery(\"table tr:first\"); // This will select the first row.</p>\n<p>jQuery(\"table tr:last\"); // this will select the last row.</p>\n<p>[/code]></p>\n<p>I was trying to select all cells that were blank or empty so I used the following;</p>\n<p>[code:c#]</p>\n<p>$(\"#myIDName td:blank\"); //Find all in table.</p>\n<p>[/code]></p>\n<p>This worked fine in Firefox, but created all kinds of Havoc. I do not believe this is officially supported by the JQuery group.</p>\n<p>I was able to solve the problem using the following change to my selector.</p>\n<p>[code:c#]</p>\n<p>$(\"#myIDName td:empty\");</p>\n<p>[/code]></p>\n<p>I am assuming that blank has been deprecated or was never fully supported, either way you should just use the :empty filter.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"JQuery :empty vs :blank filters","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/j-query-empty-vs-blank-filters","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/jrc-weather-updated-to-version-1-0-2"},"frontmatter":{"title":"JRCWeather Updated to Version 1.0.2","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ian-smith-blogs-about-ben-fortas-presentation-in-seattle"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ian Smith blogs about Ben Forta's presentation in Seattle","category":"Blog"}}}}
