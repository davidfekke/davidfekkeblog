{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have seen about four sessions on Flex so far at MAX. The new features coming out in Flex 2.0 do two new things, messaging and data services. The messaging allows for real time updates of multiple Flex clients, so you can write a chat client if you wanted. You will be able to connect to a JMS server.</p>\n<p>The data services allow for flagless updates to a database server. You can use DAO objects to update an Array of objects.</p>\n<p>You can also use these two features together, so one user can add a row to a recordset, and the change is reflected in real time in all clients.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Flex new data syncing features","date":"17.01.2011","category":"Blog"},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/flex-new-data-syncing-features","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/flex-to-be-open-sourced"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Flex to be Open Sourced","category":"Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/flex-data-services-now-live-cycle-data-services"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Flex Data Services now LiveCycle Data Services","category":"Blog"}}}}
