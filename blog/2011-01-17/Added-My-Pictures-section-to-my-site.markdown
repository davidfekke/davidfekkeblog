I just added a 'My Pictures' [section](http://www.fekke.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewImageList&directory=2006_0527) to my web site. I bought my father a digital camera for XMas a couple of years ago. He has been bugging me lately for a way he can add Photos to my web site.

I though about just creating a Flikr account, but I thought it would be easier if my father could just copy the folder of JPS to a folder on my website.

So I created a ColdFusion based image browser. I even wrote a function in Java to resize the images to thumbnails once he uploads them to my site.

I am planning to add a Spry based viewer next.
