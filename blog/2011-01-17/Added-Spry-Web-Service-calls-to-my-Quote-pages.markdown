I have two different quote pages that I have updated to use the new Spry framework from Adobe.

I am using SOAP based web service calls from my web site to get new quotes, rather than having to reload the page. One of my quote pages is a quote from [Steven Wright](http://www.fekke.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.wrightAjax)

I also have a [quote from Mr. Spock](http://www.fekke.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.spockquote).

I upgraded my site last year to xhtml, so it made it that much easier to add the Spry framework. Release 1.1 of Spry uses a namespace in the html tag.

<div class="code"><font color="NAVY"><html xmlns=<font color="BLUE">"[http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml](http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml)"</font> xmlns:spry=<font color="BLUE">"[http://ns.adobe.com/spry](http://ns.adobe.com/spry)"</font>></font></div>
