Adam Lehman of Adobe gave a couple of presentations on ColdFusion 8 yesterday in Jacksonville. I went to the one he gave at the JaxFusion user group yesterday.

Adam will be giving the same presentation tomorrow at the Tampa ColdFusion User Group. The meeting [location](http://www.tbfusion.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=meet.location) is by the airport in Tampa at the International Academy of Design and Technology.
